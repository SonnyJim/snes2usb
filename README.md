# snes2usb
Allows a SNES multitap (and maybe other peripherals) to be connected via USB to modern devices.

Hardware required:
A female SNES connector, places like Aliexpress have extension cables you can cut down, but beware they might not have enough wires connected

Arduino Teensy/Pro Micro/Leonardo - Pretty much any one of these will do, although I'd avoid the Teensy as it's IDE install is a bit how-ya-doing.

Future stuff:
Mouse support would be cool.  Also any other peripheral that makes sense.
