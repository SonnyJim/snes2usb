# snes2usb
Allows a SNES multitap (and maybe other peripherals) to be connected via USB to modern devices.

Hardware required:
A female SNES connector, places like Aliexpress have extension cables you can cut down, but beware they might not have enough wires connected
Arduino Teensy/Pro Micro/Leonardo - Pretty much any one of these will do, I'd avoid the Teensy as it's IDE install is a bit how-ya-doing.

Future stuff:
At present it only supports the multitap, rather than just one controller.  Also mouse support would be cool.
